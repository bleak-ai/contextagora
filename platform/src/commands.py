_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT = """Download files written in this session

Scan the conversation history for files written using the Write tool in this session.

**If a hint was provided after `/download`** (e.g. `/download csv` or `/download report`), use it to match against filenames or paths — pick the best match.

**If no hint was provided**, use all written files.

---

## Rules

- Construct each download link using this format:
  `[filename](/api/files/download?path=URL_ENCODED_FULL_PATH)`
  where the path is URL-encoded (e.g. `/tmp/data.csv` → `/api/files/download?path=%2Ftmp%2Fdata.csv`).

- If **one file** matches → reply with a single download link, no extra commentary.

- If **multiple files** match → list them all as download links, putting the most recently written one first with a "(latest)" label.

- If **no files were written** in this session → say "No files written in this session." and nothing else.

Do not explain your reasoning. Just output the link(s).
